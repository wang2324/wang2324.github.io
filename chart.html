    <p class="w3-opacity">Scientists define energy as the ability to do work. Modern civilization is possible because people have learned how to change energy from one form to another and then use it to do work. We use energy to move cars along roads and boats through water, to cook food on stoves, to make ice in freezers, and to light our homes. Many forms of energy exist, but they all fall into two basic categories:Potential energy and Kinetic energy. We use many different energy sources to do work. Energy sources are classified as renewable or nonrenewable. Renewable and nonrenewable energy can be used as primary energy sources and converted into secondary energy sources such as electricity and hydrogen. When people use electricity in their homes, the electrical power is probably generated by burning coal or natural gas, by a nuclear reaction, or by a hydroelectric plant on a river, to name just a few sources. When people fill up a carâ€™s gasoline tank, the energy source is petroleum (gasoline) refined from crude oil and may include fuel ethanol made by growing and processing corn. Coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, petroleum, and ethanol are called energy sources.</p>
